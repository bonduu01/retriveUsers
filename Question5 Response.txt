I recently read article on techcabal blog about a merger between Kenya-based maternal care and e-commerce platform MumsVillage and Babybliss Nigeria, As a dad who recently had a baby girl, it came as good news to both myself and my wife, we now have an option to purchase on an e-commerce site specially dedicated to maternal and child care products.

As I read through, I got to know a little bit about both companies, MumsVillage is Kenyan based, an online community which supports pregnant women and parents in Kenya on their motherhood and parenting journeys while BabyBliss is a Nigerian based company, founded in 2017, retails products for expectant mothers and their babies from local and international manufacturers/suppliers.

In 2019, MumsVillage lauched its e-commerce arm, MumsVillageShop, to leverage on the trust of the community to provide access to a wide range of quality maternal and baby products. 

What I liked about the article:

- Detailed information about two companies and its service offerings in Nigeria.
- The article is easily understandable, no big grammars, easily comprehensible.
- No techy jargons.

What I disliked:

- No url redirect links on article to both companies shopping landing pages, I had to google to get that.
- No mention of payment channels e-commerce sites supports such as card payment schemes i.e. mastercard, e.t.c or if it supports international payments using foreign credit/debit cards.
