To troubleshoot this issue as a root user,  below are issues I have experienced regarding high latency or slow TAT's and how to troubleshoot:

Probably causes:

- Insufficient space on hard disk
- Insufficient Memory
- Application log file size
- Application log writing issues
- Database related issues

Below is sequence of action carried.

- Advice customer to confirm internet connectivity on device used to call web application service while I call same service to confirm service availability.

On linux cli run the following commands below:

# View web application logs
journalctl -u webapplication_name.service 

# Comb Web Server logs for any clue on possible errors

# Check status of web application or RDBMS for any hint on error
systemctl status application_name
systemctl status rdmbs

# Troubleshoot to view resource utilization to detect any system bottlenecks by running command below:
vmstat -S M

# Run command below to confirm hard disk space availability
df -h

# In addition to running hard disk space, I would check the /tmp folder if it has enough space.

# I would run command below to track memory usage, track what memory was used, memory available
free

# Or run command below:
top

# I would run command to check web application and web server application log file size
du -h /webApplication.log 
du -h /webserver.log

# In some cases, database not properly normalized might cause delay issues when queried or if a particular JOIN sql script is badly written, or a large database with no unique index on a table frequently queried, this all might cause delay issues...These issues are all related to design issues, experienced this issuses working with startups companies years back.
